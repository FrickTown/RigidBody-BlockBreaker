# Rigid Body Block Breaker
## A physics-based twist on a classic game concept
Ever played a block breaker game, and thought to yourself: `"man, this ball is moving very linearly...?"`  
Well here's the solution to your problem!

Rigid Body Block Breaker is a game where you control a paddle that can smack a ball with as much force as your mouse arm is capable of outputting.
Use your fine motor skills to carefully lob the ball to your target, or uncontrolled spasms and pray the ball lands somewhere appropriate.
